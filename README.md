R and LaTex code for a paper together with Jonas Sch√∂ley and Francisco Villavicencio: "A unified framework of demographic time"

The paper was first presented at the EAPS Health and Morbidity working group conference in Prague in September, 2015. It was also presented as PAA 2016, ADEH 2016, the 2016 Berkeley Formal Demography Workshop, and EPC 2016. It is presently accepted to Genus (DOI 10.1186/s41118-017-0024-4) and going through proofs. I'll post the bibtex citation here when it's published online.
